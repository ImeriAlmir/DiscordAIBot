It is designed to be fast, portable, and secure, and can be used to develop a wide range of applications, including desktop applications, mobile apps, web applications, and enterprise software. Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it highly portable. Java is widely used for both client-side and server-side development, and is one of the most popular programming languages in use today."
